# Explainable Loan Approval Decision System

## Overview
This project focuses on building a transparent loan approval decision system
using classical machine learning models and explainability techniques.

The objective is to balance predictive performance, interpretability, and
fairness in financial decision-making contexts.

## Dataset
Loan approval dataset containing applicant demographics, financial attributes,
and loan approval outcomes.

## Methodology (In Progress)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Logistic regression baseline
- Tree-based model comparison
- Explainability using SHAP
- Fairness analysis

## Status
🚧 Work in progress. Models and analysis are being iteratively improved.
